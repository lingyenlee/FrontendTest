# FrontendTest
A fantasy registry web app with search filters to query details of 1337 gnomes. Created using React.js, CSS grid, flexbox with unit testing using enzyme.

## Getting Started

Download or clone the tutorial project code from https://github.com/lingyenlee/FrontendTest .

## Install

Install all required npm packages by running "npm install" from the command line in the project root folder (where the package.json is located).

## View the app

The app can be viewed in 2 ways:
1) Start the app by running "npm start" from the command line in the project root folder, goto http://localhost:3000/ to view the app
2) The app is also deployed on heroku with the url https://pacific-cove-49600.herokuapp.com/ .

## Libraries used for the app

1. Lodash - used to make the filtering functions easier to write.
2. Axios - used to make the fetch request and return the data object (json) as it is.
3. React-select - used for the reusable dropdown menu component as it can be easily configured.
4. Jest/Enzyme - used for performing unit test and works well with jest.
